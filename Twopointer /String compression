/*
Problem: String Compression (LeetCode 443)

Description:
Given a vector of characters `chars`, compress it using the following rules:
- For each group of consecutive repeating characters:
  - Write the character followed by the count of repetitions (if count > 1).
- The compression must be done in-place.
- Return the new length of the compressed array.

Example 1:
Input:
chars = ['a','a','b','b','c','c','c']

Output:
chars = ['a','2','b','2','c','3']
Return length = 6

Example 2:
Input:
chars = ['a']

Output:
chars = ['a']
Return length = 1

Approach:
We use the Two Pointer technique.

Steps:
1. Use one pointer `i` to read characters from the array.
2. Use another pointer `index` to write the compressed result in-place.
3. For each character group:
   - Count how many times the current character repeats consecutively.
   - Write the character to the array.
   - If the count is greater than 1, convert the count to a string and
     write each digit into the array.
4. Continue until all characters are processed.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place, no extra space used)
