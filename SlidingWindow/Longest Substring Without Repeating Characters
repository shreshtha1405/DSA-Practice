/*
Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode 3)

Approach:
We use the sliding window technique with two pointers.
The window is expanded by moving the right pointer.
If a character is already present in the window, we shrink
the window from the left until all characters become unique again.

We use an unordered_map to store the frequency of characters
inside the current window.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

        int maxLen = 0;

        for(int r = 0; r < n; r++){
            while(mpp[s[r]] > 0){
                mpp[s[l]]--;
                l++;
            }

            mpp[s[r]]++;
            maxLen = max(maxLen, r - l + 1);
