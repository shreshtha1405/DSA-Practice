/*
Problem: Minimum Size Subarray Sum (LeetCode 209)

Approach:
This problem is solved using the Sliding Window technique.
We maintain a window with two pointers (left and right) and keep
adding elements to the current sum.

When the sum becomes greater than or equal to the target,
we try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum
length subarray whose sum is at least the target.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int minLen = INT_MAX;

        for (int r = 0; r < nums.size(); r++) {
            sum += nums[r];

            while (sum >= target) {
                minLen = min(minLen, r - l + 1);
                sum -= nums[l];
                l++;
            }
        }

        if (minLen == INT_MAX)
            return 0;

        return minLen;
    }
